    <p> As you guys know I've been skating for a long time. In this picture I think I was about 13 years old. Now, I'm 16 years old and it's been 4 years since, I last took this picture. The program has changed drastically, we usually had our Gala on the ice skating with the stars, those that are famous figureskaters, artist, actress, and billionares. Now, the Galas are more formal in a ballroom.</p>
